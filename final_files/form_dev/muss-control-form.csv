2,"Justice is not the prerogative of the rich and powerful. Every Indian has the right to seek judicial redressal for injustice done to him/her, whether it is loss of revenue or destruction of environment. He/she can demand to be heard and compensated for his/her loss because the framers of our Constitution, themselves having suffered the ignominy of unfair practices under the British, ensured in the Constitution that Modern India would have an independent judiciary, so that all citizens would feel free to approach the judicial system and settle their disputes lawfully. The Indian judiciary is fully integrated starting with the Apex Court at the top going down to the lowest courts in the districts. The structure of the Indian judicial system is elaborate. It covers major conflict areas such as disputes between two states and goes right down to the level of Lok Adalats that settle the simplest civil disputes at the village level.","Justice is not the prerogative of the rich and powerful.

6,"The framers of our Constitution wanted us to live in a nation that upholds freedom of thought and expression and where there is justice for all. For that to happen we need a judicial system that is free from all influences and acts impartially. To maintain the independence of the judiciary certain features were created for those serving in the judicial system:To ensure that judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts do not suffer from insecurity of service, that is, loss of job and are not put under any pressure to deliver judgements in favour of the government, the Constitution clearly states that while the President appoints them, neither he/she nor any other person can remove them from office. ‘ This gives them ease to discharge their duties without any fear of external pressure or loss of their jobs. ‘The salary and perks of the judiciary are charged to the Consolidated Fund of India and neither the Parliament nor the Executive has any control over it. This is why the judges can deliver judgements against the bills passed by the Parliament without any fear of removal. Their personal security and that of their family is the responsibility of the State.

7,"India was still an agrarian economy and a majority of its population resided in villages. With the advent of British annexation on territories, farmers were forced to grow only cash crops such as indigo, opium and cotton at the cost of food grains. The company bought crops at the lowest possible rate, which meant the farmer made almost no profit. Then the farmers had to buy food grain as they no longer grew it; food grain and vegetables were expensive as they were scarce as not many farmers grew them anymore. This led to starvation deaths and famines. In addition to high expenses and scarcity of food grain, farmers had to pay high taxes to the British which was extracted by the oppressive zamindars, Crops like indigo reduced the quality of the soil and made it unfit for farming food crops. The company’s mishandling of the peasantry clearly shows that the company put short-term profits for themselves over long-term concern for the Indian people.","India was still an agrarian economy and the majority of its population lived in villages.

8,"It was not merely a revolt by the British army personnels or rulers of particular regions; it was a massive war which witnessed participation of kings, queens, landlords, peasants, tribals and soldiers alike. While the war actually took place in 1857, the ground for the battlefield was prepared over a course of hundred years. The British, who had initially arrived as traders, gradually embarked on a dual mission of conquest and profit in India. The victory of British troops over Bengal in the Battle of Lord Clive and Mir Zafar Plassey in 1757 was an inception of British rule in India. a With this, British moved on to becoming the rulers of the lands of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa {now Odisha) and the whole of India after 1857. Even though the revolt broke out in 1857, the undercurrents had been felt much earlier. The pursuit of exploitative political and economic policies by the British was largely resented by the diverse sections of the Indian society. All it needed was the proverbial trigger to be pulled, which eventually happened with the hanging of a young sepoy Mangal Pandey. But before you delve into the chronicle of the revolt that eventually turned into a war, it is important to understand the main causes of revolt of 1857.","It was not merely a revolt by the British army personnels or rulers of particular regions; it was a massive war which witnessed participation of kings, queens, landlords, peasants, tribals and soldiers alike.

9,"Dictatorship or Fascism became an emergent form of government in the early part of the 20th century in Europe. While there were many complex reasons for this, one of the obvious reasons was that Europe was grappling with the concept of democracy.After the First World War, many new nations came into existence. These nations were created by the break up of raperial F empires. Unfortunately, these new states had no clear political legacy as centuries of imperial rule meant that they had no political experience or class of their own other than revolutionaries. So they tried to adopt democracy but occasionally failed. Since the power of politics and its use was still beyond the understanding of most people as they lacked political experience, the few who mastered it bypassed the democratic process for their benefit. ‘This gave rise to dictatorships all over Europe, most important of which were in Italy and Germany. While dictatorships brought a semblance of political stability to the new state, they were disastrous for the overall political environment of Europe. Dictatorships were based on the attitude that military might is power and power is right. As nations, they became belligerent and aggressive.","Dictatorship or Fascism became a more common form of government in Europe in the early part of the 20th century.
